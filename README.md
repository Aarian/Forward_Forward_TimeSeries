Here I have implemented the [forward-forward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13345) algorithm for the time series (speech) data. 
For this implementation, I also used [this implementation](https://github.com/mpezeshki/pytorch_forward_forward) for digit classification.
The .ipynb contains all the required and necessary informations.
