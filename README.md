# Forward-Forward algorithm on time series
* Here is the implementation of the [forward-forward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13345) algorithm for the time series (speech) data, for my conversational AI course.
* I also used [this implementation](https://github.com/mpezeshki/pytorch_forward_forward) for digit classification and was extended to time series data. 
* The .ipynb contains all the required and necessary information.
